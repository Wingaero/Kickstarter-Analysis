# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose: 
#### 	The purpose of this analysis is to provide the client with statistical information about what makes crowdfunded projects successful as well as what may lead them to be unsuccessful. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
####	Some challenges or difficulties that can be encountered when analyzing this dataset include: 
####		(?)Accounting for the theater-building projects as successful plays(?) -- later stage success on OBoG
####		(?)Misreading the October bump in TOBoLD as higher chance for success(?)

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	Never start a theater campaign in late Autumn/Winter
	Campaigns that start in Summer have a much higher chance of success

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
