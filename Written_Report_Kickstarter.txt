# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose: 
#### 	The purpose of this analysis is to provide the client with statistical information about what makes crowdfunded projects successful 
as well as what may lead them to be unsuccessful. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
####	Some challenges or difficulties that can be encountered when analyzing this dataset include: 
		- a challenge one could face when reading this dataset is taking the higher success rate in larger goals at face value
			- sample size
		- not accounting for the outliers in the initial dataset

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	Never start a theater campaign in late Autumn/Winter
	Campaigns that start in Summer have a much higher chance of success

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	Goal should not exeed $15000

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	There was no data on cancelled theater projects
	So few projects above $15000, would have been nice to see what goes in to making those projects successful

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	Average pledge amount vs number of backers for theater projects 
		plot variance of backers given average plege amount
		to estimate what amounts to set backing rewards at
